                 system depends on action potentials in the optic nerve fibers,
                 even before the retina receives visual input. In particular,
                 it has been suggested that correlated firing of retinal
                 ganglion cells in the same eye directs the segregation of
                 their synaptic terminals into eye-specific layers within the
                 lateral geniculate nucleus. Such correlations in electrical
                 activity were found by simultaneous recording of the
                 extracellular action potentials of up to 100 ganglion cells in
                 the isolated retina of the newborn ferret and the fetal cat.
                 These neurons fired spikes in nearly synchronous bursts
                 lasting a few seconds and separated by 1 to 2 minutes of
                 silence. Individual bursts consisted of a wave of excitation,
                 several hundred micrometers wide, sweeping across the retina
                 at about 100 micrometers per second. These concerted firing
                 patterns have the appropriate spatial and temporal properties
                 to guide the refinement of connections between the retina and
                 the lateral geniculate nucleus.",

                 with IPython Notebook to provide a flexible, lightweight, and
                 agile workflow for fully reproducible scientific research.
                 This informal and pragmatic approach uses IPython Notebook to
                 capture the steps in a scientific computation as it is
                 gradually automated and made ready for publication, without
                 mandating the use of any separate application that can
                 constrain scientific exploration and innovation. The resulting
                 notebook concisely records each step involved in even very
                 complex computational processes that led to a particular
                 figure or numerical result, allowing the complete chain of
                 events to be replicated automatically. Lancet was originally
                 designed to help solve problems in computational neuroscience,
                 such as analyzing the sensitivity of a complex simulation to
                 various parameters, or collecting the results from multiple
                 runs with different random starting points. However, because
                 it is never possible to know in advance what tools might be
                 required in future tasks, Lancet has been designed to be
                 completely general, supporting any type of program as long as
                 it can be launched as a process and can return output in the
                 form of files. For instance, Lancet is also heavily used by
                 one of the authors in a separate research group for launching
                 batches of microprocessor simulations. This general design
                 will allow Lancet to continue supporting a given research

                 spiking activity that sweep across the ganglion cell layer
                 during a limited developmental period, before the onset of
                 visual experience. The spatiotemporal patterns encoded in the
                 waves are believed to be instructive for the wiring of
                 functional connections throughout the visual system. However,
                 the ontogeny of retinal waves is still poorly documented due
                 to relatively low resolution of conventional recording
                 techniques. Here, we have characterized the spatiotemporal
                 features of mouse retinal waves from birth until eye opening
                 with unprecedented detail using a large-scale, dense
                 4,096-channel multielectrode array that allowed us to record
                 from the entire neonatal retina at near cellular resolution.
                 We found that early cholinergic waves propagate with random
                 trajectories over large areas with low ganglion cell
                 recruitment. They become slower, smaller and denser when GABAA
                 signalling matures, beyond postnatal day (P) 7. Glutamatergic
                 influences dominate from P10, coinciding with profound changes
                 in activity dynamics. At that time waves cease to be random,
                 beginning to show repetitive trajectories confined to a few
                 localised hotspots. These hotspots gradually tile the retina
                 with time, and disappear after eye opening. Our observations
                 demonstrate that retinal waves undergo major spatiotemporal
                 changes during ontogeny. Our results support the hypothesis
                 that cholinergic waves guide the refinement of retinal targets
                 while glutamatergic waves may also support the wiring of
                 retinal receptive fields.",

                 evidence that this activity influences the development of
                 circuits within the retina itself. We demonstrate here that
                 the neural substrate that generates waves in the mouse retina
                 develops through three distinct stages. First, between
                 embryonic day 16 and birth [postnatal day 0 (P0)], we observed
                 both large, propagating waves inhibited by nicotinic
                 acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonists and small clusters
                 of cells displaying nonpropagating, correlated calcium
                 increases that were independent of nAChR activation. Second,
                 between P0 and P11, we observed only larger propagating waves
                 that were abolished by toxins specific to alpha3 and beta2
                 subunit-containing nAChRs. Third, between P11 and P14 (eye
                 opening) we observed propagating activity that was abolished
                 by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. The time course
                 of this developmental shift was dramatically altered in
                 retinas from mice lacking the beta2 nAChR subunit or the beta2
                 and beta4 subunits. These retinas exhibited a novel circuit at
                 P0, no spontaneous correlated activity between P1 and P8, and
                 the premature induction at P8 of an ionotropic glutamate
                 receptor-based circuit. Retinas from postnatal mice lacking
                 the alpha3 nAChR subunit exhibited spontaneous, correlated
                 activity patterns that were similar to those observed in
                 embryonic wild-type mice. In alpha3-/- and beta2-/- mice, the
                 development and distribution of cholinergic neurons and
                 processes and the density of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and

                 RGC dendrites is delayed. These results indicate that retinal

                 adult neural circuits, but its role in coordinating activity
                 during development is less known. The developing retina
                 exhibits retinal waves--spontaneous depolarizations that
                 propagate among retinal interneurons and drive retinal
                 ganglion cells (RGCs) to fire correlated bursts of action
                 potentials. During development, two connexin isoforms,
                 connexin 36 (Cx36) and Cx45, are expressed in bipolar cells
                 and RGCs, and therefore provide a potential substrate for
                 coordinating network activity. To determine whether gap
                 junctions contribute to retinal waves, we compared spontaneous
                 activity patterns using calcium imaging, whole-cell recording,
                 and multielectrode array recording in control,
                 single-knock-out (ko) mice lacking Cx45 and double-knock-out
                 (dko) mice lacking both isoforms. Wave frequency, propagation
                 speed, and bias in propagation direction were similar in
                 control, Cx36ko, Cx45ko, and Cx36/45dko retinas. However, the
                 spontaneous firing rate of individual retinal ganglion cells
                 was elevated in Cx45ko retinas, similar to Cx36ko retinas
                 (Hansen et al., 2005; Torborg and Feller, 2005), a phenotype
                 that was more pronounced in Cx36/45dko retinas. As a result,
                 spatial correlations, as assayed by nearest-neighbor
                 correlation and functional connectivity maps, were
                 significantly altered. In addition, Cx36/45dko mice had
                 reduced eye-specific segregation of retinogeniculate
                 afferents. Together, these findings suggest that although Cx36

                 The continued presence of this activity in the mature retina
                 would interfere with the transmission of information about the
                 visual scene. The mechanisms responsible for the disappearance
                 of retinal waves are not well understood, but one hypothesis
                 is that visual experience is important. To test this
                 hypothesis, we monitored the developmental changes in
                 spontaneous retinal activity of both normal mice and mice
                 reared in the dark. Using multi-electrode array recordings, we
                 found that retinal waves in normally reared mice are present
                 at postnatal day (P) 9 and begin to break down shortly after
                 eye opening, around P15. By P21, waves have disappeared, and
                 synchronous firing is comparable with that observed in the
                 adult (6 weeks). In mice raised in the dark, we found a
                 similar time course for the disappearance of waves. However,
                 at P15, dark-reared retinas occasionally showed abnormally
                 long periods of relative inactivity, not seen in controls.
                 Apart from this quiescence, we found no striking differences
                 between the patterns of spontaneous retinal activity from
                 normal and dark-reared mice. We therefore suggest that visual

                 is required to establish and maintain this segregation. We
                 show that despite the presence of retinal activity, segregated
                 projections desegregate when the structure of activity is
                 altered. Early in development, spontaneous retinal activity in
                 the no b-wave (nob) mouse is indistinguishable from that of
                 wild-type mice, and eye-specific segregation proceeds
                 normally. But, around eye-opening, spontaneous and visually
                 evoked activity in nob retinas become abnormal, coincident
                 with a failure to preserve precise eye-specific territories.

                 acquisition, and experimental conditions are indispensable for
                 the analysis and management of experimental data within a lab.
                 However, only rarely are metadata available in a structured,
                 comprehensive, and machine-readable form. This poses a severe
                 problem for finding and retrieving data, both in the
                 laboratory and on the various emerging public data bases.
                 Here, we propose a simple format, the {"}open metaData Markup
                 Language{"} (odML), for collecting and exchanging metadata in
                 an automated, computer-based fashion. In odML arbitrary
                 metadata information is stored as extended key-value pairs in
                 a hierarchical structure. Central to odML is a clear
                 separation of format and content, i.e., neither keys nor
                 values are defined by the format. This makes odML flexible
                 enough for storing all available metadata instantly without
                 the necessity to submit new keys to an ontology or controlled
                 terminology. Common standard keys can be defined in
                 odML-terminologies for guaranteeing interoperability. We
                 started to define such terminologies for neurophysiological
                 data, but aim at a community driven extension and refinement
                 of the proposed definitions. By customized terminologies that
                 map to these standard terminologies, metadata can be named and
                 organized as required or preferred without softening the
                 standard. Together with the respective libraries provided for
                 common programming languages, the odML format can be
                 integrated into the laboratory workflow, facilitating
                 automated collection of metadata information where it becomes
                 available. The flexibility of odML also encourages a community

                 about the expression and function of gap junctions.
                 Previously, we reported that retinal ganglion cells in mice
                 lacking the neuronal gap junction protein connexin 36 (Cx36)
                 have nearly normal firing patterns at postnatal day 4 (P4) but
                 many more asynchronous action potentials than wild-type mice
                 at P10 (Torborg et al. [2005] Nat. Neurosci. 8:72-78). With
                 the goal of understanding the origin of this increased
                 activity in Cx36-/- mice, we used a transgenic mouse (Deans et
                 al. [2001] Neuron 31:477-485) to characterize the
                 developmental expression of a Cx36 reporter in the retina. We
                 found that Cx36 was first detected weakly at P2 and gradually
                 increased in expression until it reached an adult pattern at
                 P14. Although the onset of expression varied by cell type, we
                 identified Cx36 in the glycinergic AII amacrine cell,
                 glutamatergic cone bipolar cell, and retinal ganglion cells
                 (RGCs). In addition, we used calcium imaging and
                 multielectrode array recording to characterize further the
                 firing patterns in Cx36-/- mice. Both correlated and
                 asynchronous action potentials in P10 Cx36-/- RGCs were
                 significantly inhibited by bath application of an ionotropic
                 glutamate receptor antagonist, indicating that the increase in
                 activity was synaptically mediated. Hence, both the expression
                 patterns and the physiology suggest an increasing role for
                 Cx36-containing gap junctions in suppressing RGC firing

                 adaptation on the circuits controlling retinal waves. Mouse
                 retinal waves were recorded in vitro for up to 35 h with a
                 multielectrode array in presence of the GABA(A) antagonist
                 bicuculline, allowing us to obtain a precise, time-resolved
                 characterization of homeostatic effects in this preparation.
                 Experiments were performed at P4-P6, when GABA(A) signaling is
                 depolarizing in ganglion cells, and at P7-P10, when GABA(A)
                 signaling is hyperpolarizing. At all ages, bicuculline
                 initially increased the wave sizes and other activity metrics.
                 At P5-P6, wave sizes decreased toward control levels within a
                 few hours while firing remained strong, but this ability to
                 compensate disappeared entirely from P7 onwards. This
                 demonstrates that homeostatic control of spontaneous retinal
                 activity maintains specific network dynamic properties in an
                 age-dependent manner, and suggests that the underlying

                 after-hyperpolarization (sAHP) operating on two different
                 temporal scales. As a result, the simulated network exhibits
                 competition between a desynchronizing effect of spontaneous,
                 cell-intrinsic bursts, and the synchronizing effect of
                 synaptic transmission during retinal waves. Cell-intrinsic
                 bursts decouple the retinal network through activation of the

                 operating at a transition point between purely local and
                 global functional connectedness, which corresponds to a

                 storage and curation of data, analysis code and experimental
                 protocols, together with the ability to execute data analysis.
                 While the CARMEN system is initially focused on
                 electrophysiology data, it is equally applicable to many
                 domains outside neuroscience. Metadata are essential for a
                 system such as CARMEN that has the potential to store
                 thousands of data collections and analysis codes; without
                 metadata, resource discovery, interpretation, evaluation and
                 re-use would be severely impeded. Therefore, when any resource
                 (data, service or workflow) is added to the system, users must
                 provide adequate descriptions. These descriptions form a

                 by multiple genes that disrupt brain circuits. While great
                 progress has been made in identifying schizophrenia
                 susceptibility genes, these studies have left two major
                 unanswered mechanistic questions: is there a core biochemical
                 mechanism that these genes regulate, and what are the
                 electrophysiological consequences of the altered gene
                 expression? Because clinical studies implicate abnormalities
                 in neuronal networks, we developed a system for studying the
                 neurophysiology of neuronal networks in vitro where the role
                 of candidate disease genes can be rapidly assayed. Using this
                 system we focused on three postsynaptic proteins DISC1, TNIK
                 and PSD-93/DLG2 each of which is encoded by a schizophrenia
                 susceptibility gene. We also examined the utility of this
                 assay system in bipolar disorder (BD), which has a strong
                 genetic overlap with schizophrenia, by examining the bipolar
                 disorder susceptibility gene Dctn5. The global neuronal
                 network firing behavior of primary cultures of mouse
                 hippocampus neurons was examined on multi-electrode arrays
                 (MEAs) and genes of interest were knocked down using RNAi

                 parameters demonstrated phenotypes for these genes compared
                 with controls. Moreover, the different genes disrupted network
                 properties and showed distinct and overlapping effects. These
                 data show multiple susceptibility genes for complex

                 experiments before the final conclusions have been drawn that
                 MEA technology has a potential for standard in vitro

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: The role played by early neural activity in
                 shaping retinal functions has not yet been established. In the
                 developing vertebrate retina, ganglion cells fire spontaneous
                 bursts of action potentials before the onset of visual
                 experience. This spontaneous bursting disappears shortly after
                 birth or eye opening. In the present study, we have
                 investigated whether the outgrowth of receptive fields in
                 turtle retinal ganglion cells is affected by early spontaneous
                 bursting or by early visual experience. RESULTS: Ganglion
                 cells normally stop bursting spontaneously 2-4 weeks
                 post-hatching, the time when receptive-field areas reach adult
                 size. When turtles are reared in the dark, the spontaneous
                 bursting persists. Concomitantly, receptive-field areas expand
                 to more than twice those observed in normal adults. To test
                 whether chronic blockade of spontaneous bursting inhibits the
                 expansion of developing receptive-field areas, we have exposed
                 the retina to curare, a nicotinic cholinergic antagonist,
                 because spontaneous bursting by ganglion cells requires
                 acetylcholine. Curare was released from Elvax, a slow-release
                 polymer that was implanted in the eye. When spontaneous
                 bursting was chronically blocked with curare in hatchlings,
                 dark-induced expansion of receptive fields was abolished.
                 Moreover, receptive fields of ganglion cells exposed to curare
                 in hatchlings reared in normal light and dark cycles were
                 smaller than normal. CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly
                 suggest that early, acetylcholine-dependent spontaneous bursts
                 of activity control the outgrowth of receptive-field areas in
                 retinal ganglion cells. The onset of visual experience induces
                 the disappearance of the immature spontaneous bursts,
                 resulting in the stabilization of receptive-field areas to
                 their mature size.",

                 activity among neighboring neurons, a pattern thought to be
                 important for sculpting precise neural connectivity. Network
                 output remains relatively constant as the cellular and
                 synaptic components of these immature circuits change during
                 development, suggesting the presence of homeostatic
                 mechanisms. In the retina, spontaneous waves of activity are
                 present even before chemical synapse formation, needing gap
                 junctions to propagate. However, as synaptogenesis proceeds,
                 retinal waves become dependent on cholinergic
                 neurotransmission, no longer requiring gap junctions. Later
                 still in development, waves are driven by glutamatergic rather
                 than cholinergic synapses. Here, we asked how retinal activity
                 evolves in the absence of cholinergic transmission by using a
                 conditional mutant in which the gene encoding choline
                 acetyltransferase (ChAT), the sole synthetic enzyme for
                 acetylcholine (ACh), was deleted from large retinal regions.
                 ChAT-negative regions lacked retinal waves for the first few
                 days after birth, but by postnatal day 5 (P5), ACh-independent
                 waves propagated across these regions. Pharmacological
                 analysis of the waves in ChAT knock-out regions revealed a
                 requirement for gap junctions but not glutamate, suggesting
                 that patterned activity may have emerged via restoration of
                 previous gap-junctional networks. Similarly, in P5 wild-type
                 retinas, spontaneous activity recovered after a few hours in
                 nicotinic receptor antagonists, often as local patches of
                 coactive cells but not waves. The rapid recovery of rhythmic
                 spontaneous activity in the presence of cholinergic
                 antagonists and the eventual emergence of waves in ChAT
                 knock-out regions suggest that homeostatic mechanisms regulate

                 blocks all retinal ganglion cell (RGC) action potentials when
                 applied to the retina. In contrast, recent experiments on the
                 developing mouse that relied on multielectrode array (MEA)
                 recordings reported that EPI application decorrelates the
                 activity of neighboring RGCs and eliminates retinal waves
                 while preserving the spiking activity of many neurons. The
                 different techniques used in previous studies raise the
                 question of whether EPI has different effects on RGC activity

                 60-electrode MEA as well as patch-clamp recordings during the
                 developmental stage when retinal waves are driven by

                 eye-specific retinogeniculate projections do not develop
                 normally in these mutants. It is widely thought that the
                 developing retinas of beta2(-/-) mutants do not manifest
                 correlated activity, leading to the notion that retinal waves

  abstract = "The INCF Program on Standards for Data Sharing has a working
              group that is developing a standard for storing electrophysiology
              data in HDF5. The impetus for this effort is that many
              experimentalists are starting to use HDF5 to store data, so a
              standard would facilitate data sharing significantly. The most
              important requirement of such a standard is to accommodate the
              common types of data used in electrophysiology and also the
              metadata required to describe them. Neuroshare (an API for
              accessing electrophysiology data stored in various formats)
              defines four data types: analog signals, segments, neural events
              and experimental events; as well as some metadata. A standard
              needs to efficiently store these data types, and probably also
              imaging data and some kinds of data generated in the data
              processing chain, such as features used for spike sorting.
              Further, a standard way of storing the metadata must be
              specified. The set of metadata required to describe
              electrophysiology data is difficult to determine a priori because
              the types of experiments are so varied. So, a flexible mechanism
              must be used which allows referencing and specifying values for
              currently existing ontologies and also accommodates information
              not currently systematized. Techniques to include post-experiment
              annotations of data, and for relating different data parts, are
              also required. There are numerous projects relevant to storing
              electrophysiology data in HDF5. These include: NEO, NeuroHDF,
              brainliner.jp, klusta-team spikedetekt, BrainVisionHDF5 and
              Ovation (ovation.io). A project, NeXus Format (nexusformat.org),
              uses HDF5 to store particle physics data, but might be adaptable
              for electrophysiology. It is managed using a well-defined
              community infrastructure that may be worth emulating. So far, the
              working group entertains two approaches towards defining a
              standard, which may eventually be merged. One, currently named
              Pandora, defines a generic data model that can be used with HDF5
              or other storage back-ends. Due to the generic nature, the data
              model can be used to store various kinds of neuroscience data.
              The other proposal, called epHDF, defines domain specific
              schemata for storing electrophysiology data in HDF5. For any
              approach, a suite of test data sets to help evaluate a proposed
              standard is needed, and tools to allow validating data files are
              desirable. Details of the above considerations and the current
              state of the development of a standard will be presented.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: We have collected a comprehensive set of
                 multi-unit data on dissociated cortical cultures. Previous
                 studies of the development of the electrical activity of
                 dissociated cultures of cortical neurons each focused on
                 limited aspects of its dynamics, and were often based on small
                 numbers of observed cultures. We followed 58 cultures of
                 different densities--3000 to 50,000 neurons on areas of 30 to
                 75 mm2--growing on multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) during the
                 first five weeks of their development. RESULTS: Plating
                 density had a profound effect on development. While the
                 aggregate spike detection rate scaled linearly with density,
                 as expected from the number of cells in proximity to
                 electrodes, dense cultures started to exhibit bursting
                 behavior earlier in development than sparser cultures.
                 Analysis of responses to electrical stimulation suggests that
                 axonal outgrowth likewise occurred faster in dense cultures.
                 After two weeks, the network activity was dominated by
                 population bursts in most cultures. In contrast to previous
                 reports, development continued with changing burst patterns
                 throughout the observation period. Burst patterns were
                 extremely varied, with inter-burst intervals between 1 and 300
                 s, different amounts of temporal clustering of bursts, and
                 different firing rate profiles during bursts. During certain
                 stages of development bursts were organized into tight
                 clusters with highly conserved internal structure. CONCLUSION:
                 Dissociated cultures of cortical cells exhibited a much richer
                 repertoire of activity patterns than previously reported.
                 Except for the very sparsest cultures, all cultures exhibited
                 globally synchronized bursts, but bursting patterns changed
                 over the course of development, and varied considerably
                 between preparations. This emphasizes the importance of using
                 multiple preparations--not just multiple cultures from one
                 preparation--in any study involving neuronal cultures. These
                 results are based on 963 half-hour-long recordings. To
                 encourage further investigation of the rich range of behaviors
                 exhibited by cortical cells in vitro, we are making the data

                 bring into synchrony the bursts of neighboring cells. Waves
                 are present in the developing retina of higher and lower
                 vertebrates, which suggests that this form of activity may be
                 a common and fundamental mechanism employed in the
                 activity-dependent refinement of early patterns of visual
                 connections. Unraveling the cues encoded by the waves promises
                 to provide important insights into how interactions driven by
                 specific patterns of activity could lead to the modification
                 of connectivity during development.",

  abstract    = "Complex neural circuits in the mammalian brain develop through
                 a combination of genetic instruction and activity-dependent
                 refinement. The relative role of these factors and the form of
                 neuronal activity responsible for circuit development is a
                 matter of significant debate. In the mammalian visual system,
                 retinal ganglion cell projections to the brain are mapped with
                 respect to retinotopic location and eye of origin. We
                 manipulated the pattern of spontaneous retinal waves present
                 during development without changing overall activity levels
                 through the transgenic expression of β2-nicotinic
                 acetylcholine receptors in retinal ganglion cells of mice. We
                 used this manipulation to demonstrate that spontaneous retinal
                 activity is not just permissive, but instructive in the
                 emergence of eye-specific segregation and retinotopic
                 refinement in the mouse visual system. This suggests that
                 specific patterns of spontaneous activity throughout the
                 developing brain are essential in the emergence of specific
                 and distinct patterns of neuronal connectivity.",
